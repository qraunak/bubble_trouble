Required Features:
• bubbles travel in a parabolic path (enabled verticle motion as suggested by TA). 
• ball bouncing off the ground. (reversed the vertical direction of the bubble  )
• Introduced collision between the bubble and the bullet; the bubble and bullet disappeared after a bullet hits the bubble.
• Introduced collision between the bubble and the shooter; if a bubble touches it more than health score, the shooter is dead.

Extra Features:
• Introduced bubbles of different sizes. When a bullet hit the larger bubbles, bubbles split into smaller bubbles (half the radius of the original larger bubble) and move in horizontally opposite directions. When a bullet hit the smaller bubbles, the bubble and bullet disappear after a bullet hits it. 
• Added a score (2 digits), time (2 digits) and a health counter (1 digit). The score increases whenever bullet hits a bubble. The game gets over when we run out of time (measured in seconds) or if we run out of health (whenever the bubble hits the shooter, the health reduces by 1).

Note:
• The maximum allowed value of the score, time and health are 99, 99 and 9, respectively.
• Time is in second but is not from an independent clock. So if the game hangs or run slow, the timer will move accordingly.
• Bubble path is not mathematically parabolic. TA told me it should be linear in both directions.
