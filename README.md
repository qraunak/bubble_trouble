## CS101 Project

**All links listed on this page will only be accessible by logging into Google with IITB LDAP via SSO.**

The project in this course is optional. It is the only way for someone to get an AA grade in the course. Here we provide the description of what is the project, the rules governing the project and its evaluation and links to additional reading material for the project.

### Project Rules
- The project is to be done individually. You are not allowed to discuss with anyone including friends/family, no code sharing is allowed. No help from TAs as well. (TAs will clarify concepts as related to the course).
- The code will be subject to plagiarism checking.
- The project will be graded by taking individual vivas.
- The deadline for submitting the project is **10:30pm Sunday, Feb 27 2022.** Vivas will be held during the week from **Feb 28 2022 to March 5 2022.**
- The project has two grades: pass / nopass.
- The project will be graded as pass based on the following
    - Your code for the project compiles and runs successfully demonstrating all the required features and at least 2 extra features.
    - The code follows good programming practice (explanatory variable names, indentation, comments).
    - You should be able to explain all aspects of your code during the viva.
- The only way to obtain AA grade in the course is
    - get AB in normal evaluation, and
    - get a pass in the project.
- A nopass in the project means no change in grade obtained otherwise.
- The project cannot be used for any other kind of grade change (e.g., you cannot use the project to upgrade a BB to AB and so on), nor can it be used in lieu of any other evaluation.
- Instructorâ€™s decision about the project grade will be final.
- **No extensions to the deadline** will be given for any reason (including medical).
- Project code submission details and requirements are given in the document linked below. The submission will be on BodhiTree and link for the submission will be made available in the first week of February, 2022.

### Additional reading material project
In order to understand all the C++ that is used in the starter code, you will need to learn concepts beyond that have been taught in the course so far. In order to make this easier, here is some additional reading material -
